# Shape of an Array
# The shape of an array is the number of elements in each dimension.

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]])

print(arr.shape)
""" The example above returns (2, 4), which means that the array has 2 dimensions, where the first dimension has 2 elements and the second has 4. """
